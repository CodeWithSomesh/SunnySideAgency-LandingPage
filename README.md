2. Filling up the form
Whenever we enter the details in the signup form and submit the details then a post request is called and express handles the post request using node post function written in the "app.js" file. (Note: No validations is performed for the inputs)

When the status code is 200, whenever the server was able to post the data to Mailchimp API then it returns the 200 ok status. and when 200 status is returned then express returns "success.html" file.
